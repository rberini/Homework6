The inputs to the function should be the title/subject to search for (string), a time period to search from (string - you’ll search from that time until the present), and an API key.\n\nnews_query &lt;- function(subject, start_date = today() - 30, api_key) {\n  URL_base &lt;- \"https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=\"\n  URL_id &lt;- paste0(URL_base, subject, \"&from=\", start_date, \"&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey=\", api_key)\n  news_raw &lt;- GET(URL_id)\n  news_stories &lt;- fromJSON(rawToChar(news_raw$content), flatten = T, simplifyDataFrame = T)\n  news_stories &lt;- as_tibble(news_stories)\n  articles &lt;- pluck(news_stories, \"articles\")\n  return(articles)\n}\n\nUse your function twice to grab some data (save each as an object)\n\narticles_football &lt;- news_query(\"football\", \"2024-09-17\", \"214a818775454f13ab5ccf959e471a0f\")\narticles_baseball &lt;- news_query(subject = \"baseball\",\n                                api_key = \"214a818775454f13ab5ccf959e471a0f\")\n\nWith one of your objects, summarize the name of the source for each article. That is, find a one-way contingency table for this information\n\narticles_football |&gt;\n  group_by(source.name) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n# A tibble: 57 × 2\n   source.name         count\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Yahoo Entertainment     8\n 2 New York Post           5\n 3 CBS Sports              4\n 4 Marca                   4\n 5 Newsweek                4\n 6 BFMTV                   3\n 7 Biztoc.com              3\n 8 DW (English)            3\n 9 NBCSports.com           3\n10 [Removed]               3\n# ℹ 47 more rows\n\n\nFor each of your returned data objects, turn the publishedAt column into a date column using the lubridate package (see the PARSE DATE-TIMES section of the cheat sheet!). Then sort the two data frames, each by their new parsed date published column. Finally, create a new variable called pub_diff that is the difference in time between the articles’ published dates (use lag() with mutate()). Save the modifications as new data frames.\n\narticles_football_sorted &lt;-\n  articles_football |&gt;\n    mutate(publishedAt = ymd_hms(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    mutate(pub_diff = lag(publishedAt) - publishedAt)\n\narticles_baseball_sorted &lt;-\n  articles_baseball |&gt;\n    mutate(publishedAt = ymd_hms(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    mutate(pub_diff = lag(publishedAt) - publishedAt)\n\nChoose one of your data frames. Subset the data frame to only return the date version of publishedAt and the pub_diff variables. Then use one call to the map() function to return the mean, standard deviation, and median of these columns. You should use a custom anonymous function using ‘shorthand’ notation ((x) …). Note that the pub_diff variable includes an NA so you’ll need to set na.rm = TRUE in the calls to mean(0, sd(), and median().\n\narticles_baseball_sorted |&gt;\n  select(publishedAt, pub_diff) |&gt;\n  map(\\(x) list(mean = mean(x, na.rm = T),\n                median = median(x, na.rm = T),\n                stddev = sd(x, na.rm = T)))\n\n$publishedAt\n$publishedAt$mean\n[1] \"2024-10-11 18:02:30 UTC\"\n\n$publishedAt$median\n[1] \"2024-10-11 18:00:53 UTC\"\n\n$publishedAt$stddev\n[1] 8816.96\n\n\n$pub_diff\n$pub_diff$mean\nTime difference of 311.899 secs\n\n$pub_diff$median\nTime difference of 199 secs\n\n$pub_diff$stddev\n[1] 327.6111"
