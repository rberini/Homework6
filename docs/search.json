Then sort the two data frames, each by their new parsed date published column. Finally, create a new variable called pub_diff that is the difference in time between the articles’ published dates (use lag() with mutate()). Save the modifications as new data frames.\n\narticles_football_sorted &lt;-\n  articles_football |&gt;\n    mutate(publishedAt = ymd_hms(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    mutate(pub_diff = lag(publishedAt) - publishedAt)\n\narticles_baseball_sorted &lt;-\n  articles_baseball |&gt;\n    mutate(publishedAt = ymd_hms(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    arrange(desc(publishedAt)) |&gt;\n    mutate(pub_diff = lag(publishedAt) - publishedAt)\n\nChoose one of your data frames. Subset the data frame to only return the date version of publishedAt and the pub_diff variables. Then use one call to the map() function to return the mean, standard deviation, and median of these columns. You should use a custom anonymous function using ‘shorthand’ notation ((x) …). Note that the pub_diff variable includes an NA so you’ll need to set na.rm = TRUE in the calls to mean(0, sd(), and median().\n\narticles_baseball_sorted |&gt;\n  select(publishedAt, pub_diff) |&gt;\n  map(\\(x) list(mean = mean(x, na.rm = T),\n                median = median(x, na.rm = T),\n                stddev = sd(x, na.rm = T)))\n\n$publishedAt\n$publishedAt$mean\n[1] \"2024-10-11 17:57:19 UTC\"\n\n$publishedAt$median\n[1] \"2024-10-11 18:00:29 UTC\"\n\n$publishedAt$stddev\n[1] 8834.284\n\n\n$pub_diff\n$pub_diff$mean\nTime difference of 302.1818 secs\n\n$pub_diff$median\nTime difference of 199 secs\n\n$pub_diff$stddev\n[1] 313.3698"
