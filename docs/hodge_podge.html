<li>What is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?</li>
</ol>
<p><code>lapply()</code> applies a function to each element of a named list. The equivalent <code>purrr</code> function is <code>map()</code>.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Suppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = “kendall”) on each element of the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>lapply(X = my_list, FUN = cor, y = numeric_matrix, method = "kendall")</code> <em>additional arguments (<code>y</code> and <code>method</code>) are added after the function call</em></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>What are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?</li>
</ol>
<p><code>purrr</code> offers greater consistency across the functions. In addition, it offers useful variants and helpful functions not available to the <code>apply</code> family.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>What is a side-effect function?</li>
</ol>
<p>A side-effect function is …</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Why can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the scope of the variable within the function is contained to the local environment.</p>

<p>For each of your returned data objects, turn the publishedAt column into a date column using the lubridate package (see the PARSE DATE-TIMES section of the cheat sheet!). Then sort the two data frames, each by their new parsed date published column. Finally, create a new variable called pub_diff that is the difference in time between the articles’ published dates (use lag() with mutate()). Save the modifications as new data frames.</p>

<p>Choose one of your data frames. Subset the data frame to only return the date version of publishedAt and the pub_diff variables. Then use one call to the map() function to return the mean, standard deviation, and median of these columns. You should use a custom anonymous function using ‘shorthand’ notation ((x) …). Note that the pub_diff variable includes an NA so you’ll need to set na.rm = TRUE in the calls to mean(0, sd(), and median().</p>
