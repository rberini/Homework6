## Task 1: Conceptual Questions

1. What is the purpose of the lapply() function? What is the equivalent purrr function?
2. Suppose we have a list called my_list. Each element of the list is a numeric data frame (all columns are numeric). We want use lapply() to run the code cor(numeric_matrix, method = "kendall") on each element of the list. Write code to do this below! (Iâ€™m really trying to ask you how you specify method = "kendall" when calling lapply())
3. What are two advantages of using purrr functions instead of the BaseR apply family?
4. What is a side-effect function?
5. Why can you name a variable sd in a function and not cause any issues with the sd function?

## Task 2: Writing R Functions
